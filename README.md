# Keystone Box

This keystone box model is designed for securely mounting keystone modules in an enclosure. It comes in several variants to accommodate 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 10, or 12 keystone slots, making it suitable for various setups. The model is divided into two parts: the box itself and a detachable lid. The lid is secured with four M5 countersunk screws (6-12 mm in length).

The box includes four mounting holes on the bottom, allowing it to be easily installed on a wall or other surfaces. Each slot has a corresponding hole at the back for cable entry, and thereâ€™s a strain relief feature to secure cables using zip ties. This design ensures that your connections stay organized and protected.

This model is fully parametric and written in SwiftSCAD, allowing you to easily adjust parameters in the source code to fit your exact needs.

This model uses [SwiftSCAD](https://github.com/tomasf/SwiftSCAD), [Helical](https://github.com/tomasf/Helical) and [my Keystone library](https://github.com/tomasf/Keystone).
